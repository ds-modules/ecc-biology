There are 2 kinds of cells: markdown and code. \n- A **markdown cell**, such as this one, contains text. \n- A **code cell** contains code. In this class, we'll be using Python, but in other data science classes you might use languages such as Julia or R.\n\n### Running Cells\nTo \"run\" a code cell (i.e. tell the computer to perform the programmed instructions in the cell), select it and either:\n- Press `Shift` + `Enter` to run the cell and move to (select) the following cell.\n- Press `Command/Control` + `Enter` to run the cell but stay on the same cell. _This can be used to re-run the same cell repeatedly._\n\n- Click the Run button in the toolbar at the top of the screen. \n\n### Results and Outputs of a Cell\nWhen you run a code cell, a number of things can happen, depending on the type and contents of the cell:\n1. Running a markdown cell renders the text inside of it.\n2. Running a code cell returns the result of the code below the cell.\n    - This output may be text, a number, a visualization, or nothing at all, depending on the code!\n\nIf a code cell is running, you will see an asterisk (\\*) appear in the square brackets to the left of the cell. Once the cell has finished running, a number in brackets will replace the asterisk and any output from the code will appear under the cell. This number goes up by one each time you run a code cell, telling you the **order in which the code cells in your notebook have been run**.\n\nLet's try it! **Run the cell below to see the output.** Feel free to play around with the code—try changing 'World' to your name, and re-run it multiple times to see how the number to the left increments.","metadata":{"cell_id":"00003-058e2913-9587-45ac-8c2f-f284333ac4f3","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"print(\"Hello World!\") # Run the cell by using one of the methods we mentioned above!","metadata":{"cell_id":"00004-a9f5f74b-a641-44a7-8dd5-2f9f58c10236","deepnote_cell_type":"code","tags":["ignore"],"trusted":false},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Comments\nNotice the blue text that starts with a `#` in the code cell above.

The process of working with data can be messy and nonlinear, which a Jupyter notebook handles well because of its **flexibility**.\n\nThe power of the notebook lies in its ability to include a **variety of media** with the computation as a means to maintain **accountability, integrity, and transparency** for both the author of the notebook and the audiences that you share your work with. \n\n<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-warning\">\nIn a world in which algorithms and data analysis inform many aspects of life and where computation is getting more and more abstract, the ability to understand and reason about computational work is more important than ever.\n</div>","metadata":{"cell_id":"00033-cdd8d4fd-d181-4b60-84c6-53fce944a344","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<!-- BEGIN QUESTION -->\n\n<!-- END QUESTION -->\n\n<!-- BEGIN QUESTION -->\n\n<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n<b>Labor Question:</b> How much time did you spend completing this module?
