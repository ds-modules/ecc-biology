Managing this infection requires careful indentification of the MRSA strain and source of infection, proper choice of antibiotics, and robust prevention strategies. Active surveillance of personnel and disinfection of healthcare equipment and rooms is critical for prevention.

This map shows each California County and the rate of infection per unit of population (100,000 people). The darker red the county, the higher its MRSA infection rate is. The colorbar on the right side of the map shows the range of infection rates. Take a look at the map below and use it to answer the discussion question below. "
